\arguments{
\item{...}{Passed to the other `calc_derived_*()` functions.}

\item{verbose}{For `calc_derived()`, provide a message indicating the type of model detected.}

\item{CL}{Clearance (L/h)}

\item{V1, V}{Central volume of distribution (L).  Values are synonyms; use only one.}

\item{ka}{Absorption rate (1/hr)}

\item{tlag}{Absorption lag time (hr)}

\item{type}{Type of half-life to return. Default is \code{"all"}; see details for other options that are specific to the number of compartments.}

\item{sigdig}{Number of significant digits to be returned. Default is \code{5}.}

\item{V2}{First peripheral volume of distribution (L)}

The input parameters with standardized names (`V1`, `V2`, `V3`, `CL`, `Q2`,
and `Q3`) are also returned in the list, and if provided, additional PK
parameters of `ka` and `lag` are also returned in the list.
